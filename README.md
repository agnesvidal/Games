# Games

## About
A small website to illustrate various queries against a mysql database.
This project was created for an assignment in a course at Linnaeus university in early 2019.

The idea behind the project was to design a database as a way for users to get an overview of what
games they own, what games their friends own, and what games users could play together with those
friends. Additionally the idea was to design it in such a way that it could easily be incorporated into
another system or application.

The project was a collaboration between Agnes Vidal and Lisa Wetterberg.
